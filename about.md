We are a firm of Chartered Accountants based in Macclesfield, Cheshire.  The firm is a member of the [Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales](https://find.icaew.com/firms/macclesfield/heywood-shepherd-bas/1a0S6o) and we have adopted the Institute's principles and follow their policy of Practice Assurance. Our aim is to provide the highest ethical standards, good quality service and business expertise.

The firm is a partnership with 3 partners - 4 qualified chartered accountants and two certified accountants, with a supporting staff of 11.

The present firm was originally formed by the merger of two long established and much respected practices:-
 
**Joseph W. Shepherd & Co** was started in Central Manchester by Joseph Shepherd CBE in 1908.
 
**H Heywood & Co** was started in Macclesfield in 1946.
 
In July 2005 a local firm **Sloan and Company** merged with Heywood Shepherd.
 
Our partners and staff draw on this wealth of experience in providing a special kind of service which is both comprehensive and highly personal.  Our knowledge is regularly updated by attendance at lectures and reading of technical literature.
 
We are proud to be working with the second and third generations of old established clients alongside new business start ups of today.
 
*At Heywood Shepherd clients always come first.*
