Tax legislation becomes increasingly complex and specialist advice is essential to both business and individual clients.  This is even more the case with Self Assessment and its emphasis on compliance and its strict penalty regime.

Heywood Shepherd can help with all aspects of Self Assessment.  We can complete tax return forms - personal, partnership VAT and company returns - submit them to HM Revenue and Customs - either on paper or electronically - and advise on tax liability. We can complete repayment claim forms to reclaim tax overpaid.

In addition to compliance work, the agreement of liabilities and repayments, we can also provide a comprehensive tax planning service.

We can also assist clients with VAT compliance and VAT planning matters.
